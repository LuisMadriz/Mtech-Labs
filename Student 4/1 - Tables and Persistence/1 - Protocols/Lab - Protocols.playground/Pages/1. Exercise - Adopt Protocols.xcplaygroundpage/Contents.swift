## Exercise - Adopt Protocols: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable, and Comparable
 
 Create a `Human` class with two properties: `name` of type `String`, and `age` of type `Int`. You'll need to create a memberwise initializer for the class. Initialize two `Human` instances.

import Foundation

class Human: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable, Comparable, Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int

init(name: String, age: Int) {
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

let pedro = Human(name: "Pedro", age: 25)
let ramon = Human(name: "Ramon", age: 30)
let carlos = Human(name: "Carlos", age: 20)
let jose = Human(name: "Jose", age: 40)

let people = [pedro, ramon, carlos, jose, fernando]

let sortedPeople = people.sorted(by: <)
//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol. Print both of your previously initialized `Human` objects.
print(pedro)
print(ramon)

//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `Equatable` protocol. Two instances of `Human` should be considered equal if their names and ages are identical to one another. Print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether or not your two previously initialized `Human` objects are equal to eachother (using `==`). Then print the result of a boolean expression evaluating whether or not your two previously initialized `Human` objects are not equal to eachother (using `!=`).
print(pedro != ramon)
print(pedro == ramon)
//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `Comparable` protocol. Sorting should be based on age. Create another three instances of a `Human`, then create an array called `people` of type `[Human]` with all of the `Human` objects that you have initialized. Create a new array called `sortedPeople` of type `[Human]` that is the `people` array sorted by age.
print(sortedPeople)

//:  Make the `Human` class adopt the `Codable` protocol. Create a `JSONEncoder` and use it to encode as data one of the `Human` objects you have initialized. Then use that `Data` object to initialize a `String` representing the data that is stored, and print it to the console.
let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()
if let jsonData = try? jsonEncoder.encode(people),
let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8) {
    print(jsonString)
